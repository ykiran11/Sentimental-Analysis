Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques. It analyzes the sentiment (positive or negative) of text data, such as tweets, using a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a dataset of labeled text.

Features
Data preprocessing: The project preprocesses the text data by removing stopwords, URLs, mentions, and hashtags.
Word clouds: Visualizes the most frequent words in positive and negative sentiment tweets using word clouds.
Naive Bayes classifier: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed text data to classify sentiments as positive or negative.
Evaluation: Evaluates the classifier's performance on a test dataset, reporting the accuracy for both positive and negative sentiments.
How to Use
Dependencies: Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk wordcloud matplotlib
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash

Run the Code: Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
cd sentiment-analysis
python sentiment_analysis.py
View Results: After running the script, you'll see the evaluation results printed in the console, along with the word clouds visualizations.
Dataset
